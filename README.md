# cracking-coding-interview-solutions

My own solutions and commentaries for the exercises of the book Cracking the Coding Interview, written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

I highly recomend this book because the writing is great and the exercises are quite a challenge. Its perfect for preparing as best you can for interviews involving algorithms and data structures, as well as system design and behavioral questions.

The book is avalaible only in paper version, in the major stores.
